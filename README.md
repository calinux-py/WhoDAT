## Features

### üåê Domain Analyzer
Analyze URLs, email addresses, and IP addresses to reveal their threat level:
- **Website Analysis**: Search if a website is a known malicious site and take a secure screenshot using URLScan.io.
- **Email Analysis**: Verifies if email domains are free, disposable, or associated with suspicious activity.
- **URL Analysis**: Scans URLs to detect malware, phishing attempts, and suspicious redirects.
- **IP Address Analysis**: Checks if an IP address has been associated with previous malicious activity.
- **WHOIS Data**: Retrieves WHOIS information for domains to confirm registration dates, geographical origins, and other key details.

### üì® Header Analyzer
Uncover security issues hidden in email headers:
- **IP Address Analysis**: Extracts originating IPs and determines their geographic and ISP origins. IP addresses from outside the US are flagged (I'm American - edit the code to change noob).
- **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC**: Validates authentication records to detect spoofing attempts.
- **Intermediary Hop Analysis**: Identifies intermediate servers through header inspection.

### üîç Sentiment Analyzer
Detect phishing and other sus language in email content:
- **Content Analysis**: Scans for urgency cues, suspicious language, and embedded links.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses AI to provide a classification score and risk assessment based on content indicators.

### üìé Attachment Analyzer
Ensure attachments are safe before opening:
- **File Scanning**: Uploads files to VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis to see if malicious or sus.
- **Real-Time Reports**: Displays detailed findings from VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis, including detection by antivirus engines and potential threat levels.
